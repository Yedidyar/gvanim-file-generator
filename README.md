# Gvanim file generator

### What the hell is this repo??

The employees at Gvanim need to fill out a LOT of documents for every new volunteer, with much of the data being the same (e.g., names, id, phone, etc.) across all of them.
So this is a simple automation and GUI to fill repeated fields automatically.
